        <button>join now </button width="200px"> 
        <p>My stock market jenoury is not like others. I have already listned about stock market but I don't have any professional knowladge
            in it. once I was watching a youtube video and a add comes in which there was guru trade 7 was mention and mentioned that it is a 
            trading platform though which you can trade binary. I was not fimiler with any type of binary or swing or other types on that days 
            but after watching the add I just casually downloaded the app and and start demo trading in it without any knowladge. when I make 
            and good profit in binary I said to my mom that please give me some money I'll make it double or tripple she don't give me the money.
            I she gives then I will also like other traders who comes , make loses and go back but I continue my demo trading in it and I was making
            a good profit in demo that time. my fater was little fimiler with stock market so he don't refuse my desire and gave me a little hand
            . I started watfching youtube videos about trading investing and others. I didn't took any course to learn stock market because it
            was not my primary work so I learn it side by side. I have learnt so many of strategies and indicators and price action that time
            and after aroun 7-8 months with permession of my fater my mom agreed to open a demat account for me and my first capital was 100rs
            and it was enough for me to learn , I have made a profit of 0.40 rs and I was litrelly very happy because it is first income of my life
            which was made by my skills but on the same day I forget to square off my trade and it get auto square off and the broker charges
            me 118 rs because I took two trades and yes I have leaved binary trading. So I have lost my first capital in first day of my trading
            but there was no pain of my charges in my mind even I have proud on me that I have made a first encome of my life.
            then I start collection money to trade. On that thime there was a function in our family and so many relatives was there and when they 
            go they give money to me as per indian tradation. So thanks for indian tradation because I have collected 1000rs as my first self 
            made capital for trading. I have traded a lot with this capital and learned so many thing and concepts about trading. like all I was
            also in loss but my capital was small so my losses was also small and acceptable for me. Then a big change come in my life when I 
            have actived my f&o section of trading. I litrally lose my 50% captial on a singal day, not because of my loss but with my brokerage
            and charges then I put my further money in swing trading and I made a good profit but I booked it early so my brokrage was more Then
            my profit.
            and after all this I switched to a discount broker and start trading. I also collected around 500rs for trading and start learning.
            Then a miricle happened an I got selected in inspire award by my school and I got around 10000 rs because of this. I convenced my 
            mom and started trading with 10000 rs first I make profit of 2000 in just 1.5 week but there is a mistake happened by me, I modified
            my strategie according to youtubers and then the loss face started , I was litrally broked that time I was in loss of 10% of my capital
            then I followed proper risk management and start again by taking break of some days. I have recovered my 900rs and now I was very close
            to cover all of my loses but a bloody fucking quarterly sattlementd day comes and my all the capital got withdraw in my mother's bank 
            accound and my mom said that I want 2000rs and I said ok , then my downfall starts and I was on loss of 1000 rs again then I recovered
            it properly and now I'am in front of you as a successful trader and a investor also.
